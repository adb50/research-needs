# Effective and Efficient Route Choice Model Design

How do we estimate and apply route choices models that are:
 - behaviorally consistent 
 - mathematically consistant [ i.e. they don't exhibit the "Valencia Paradox" ]
 - computationally feasible [ i.e. can be run within the scope of a travel demand model ], and
 - are tractable.
