This website is a sandbox for research needs to support decision-making 
and design through useful transportation planning analysis.  These research needs are not 
necessarily fully thought-out yet and would benefit from collaborative refinement and 
widespread support.  It is sponsored by the [Transportation Research Board](http://www.trb.org) 
(TRB) Committee on Planning Applications (ADB50). We are using [GitHub](http://github.com) 
to manage this site along with the developing research needs because it offers tools for 
open collaboration, transparency, and traceability/version control.

### How to do I participate in developing research needs?

If you have a topic area that you think is a valid research need for this industry, you can 
add it to the mix – even if you don't have a fully formed idea yet.  If you see a topic that 
is on this site and are interested in it or have a perspective to add, you can edit it.
Once an idea has a few interested parties and is sufficiently thought out, we can transfer 
it to the [Research Needs Database](http://rns.trb.org).  

To add or edit a research need:  

 - [Get a GitHub Account](http://github.com/join)  
 - ["Fork"](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [git repository with research needs](https://github.com/adb50/research-needs/tree/gh-pages/_ideas)  
 - [Add](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/) your research need -or- 
 [edit](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) somebody else's  
 - If you are adding a new idea, be sure and 
use [the template](https://github.com/adb50/research-needs/tree/gh-pages/_ideas) so that 
it will render correctly
 - "Commit" your changes  
 - Submit a ["Pull Request"](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) 
 to request that your changes go back into the main repository  

When the CRC sees that you have submitted a pull request, they will merge it into the main 
repository.

*You do not need to download any software in order to do this. It can all be completed 
through the web interface.*

### What will happen with them?

Nobody knows!  That said, there is a fairly defined process for progressing transportation 
research through the [National Academies of Sciences Transportation Research Board](http://www.trb.org). 
However, the National Academies is just one possibility for progressing research needs.  Another is contracting 
directly with a university either by yourself, using pooled funds, or via a research organization 
such as [http://researcHQ.org](ResearcHQ.org). The TRB research needs process is discussed below.
