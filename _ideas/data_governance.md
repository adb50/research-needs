There are a lot of data available from a variety of private sources. There are many 
variations of terms offered by these data providers. Some are permissive of all internal 
uses; others have restrictive clauses that prevent public agencies from internally sharing 
data for different purposes. Additionally, some prevent the publication or presentation of 
the data externally to the public and outside stakeholders completely; others require 
advanced approval.

Public agencies on the other hand have broad public access laws that leads to the following issues:

* How to fulfill contractual obligations while being true to existing laws?
* What are the impacts of not having such data for transportation applications?
* How should RFPs and contracts be structured to be true to the letter and spirit of both 
existing laws and data contracts?

Potential research questions:

* Are there standard terms that can be developed that define this type of data use case 
between agencies, practicioners or consultants, and stakeholders? With a standard, 
guidance/examples could be provided for permitted and non-permitted activities. For 
example, x, y, and z types of graphics are allowed without advanced approval if the 
graphics satisfy a, b, and c requirements.
