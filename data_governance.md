## Data Governance 

There is a lot of data available from a variety of private sources. Quite a few of them have restrictive use clauses which prevents public agencies from sharing data purchased for any purpose from being used for other purposes by internal stakeholders. Public agencies on the other hand have broad public access laws that leads to the following issues:

* How to fulfil contractual obligations while being true to existing laws?
* What are the impacts of not having such data for transportation applications?
* How should RFPs and contracts be structured to be true to the letter and spirit of both existing laws and data contracts?
