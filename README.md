# Transportation Planning Applications Research Needs

This repository is a sandbox for research needs that will support better decision-making 
and design through transportation planning analysis.  These research needs are not 
necessarily fully thought-out yet and would benefit from collaborative refinement and 
widespread support.  It is sponsored by the [Transportation Research Board](http://www.trb.org) 
Committee on Planning Applications.

## Participating in developing research needs

If you have a topic area that you think is a valid research need for our industry, you can 
add it to this list – even if you don't have a fully formed idea yet.  If you see a topic that 
is on this site, but you are interested in it or have a perspective to add, you can edit it.
Once an idea has a few interested parties and is sufficiently thought out, we can transfer 
it to the [Research Needs Database](http://rns.trb.org).  

To add or edit a research need:  
 - [Get a GitHub Account](http://github.com/join)
 - ["Fork"](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository
 - [Add](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/) your research need -or- 
 [edit](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) somebody else's
 - "Commit" your changes
 - Submit a ["Pull Request"](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) 
 to request that your changes go back into the main repository

*You do not need to download any software in order to do this. It can all be completed 
through the web interface.*

## What will happen with them?

Nobody knows!  That said, there is a fairly defined process for progressing transportation 
research through the [National Academies of Sciences Transportation Research Board](http://www.trb.org). 
However, that is just one possibility for progressing research needs.  Another is contracting 
directly with a university either by yourself, using pooled funds, or via a research organization 
such as [http://researcHQ.org](ResearcHQ.org). The TRB research needs process is discussed below.

### TRB Research Needs Statements

TRB maintains a [database of Research Needs](http://rns.trb.org) 
that is updated by the [TRB standing committee](http://www.trb.org/AboutTRB/StandingCommitteesMT.aspx) 
chairs and [research coordinators](http://www.trb.org/AboutTRB/crc.aspx).  Research needs 
are often generated by committee research subcommittees, committee members, or committee 
friends.

### Research Needs Selection

How research needs are selected for funding varies widely depending on the 
[research program](http://www.trb.org/ResearchFunding/ResearchFunding.aspx). 

For example, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) [Standing Committee 
on Research (SCOR)](http://research.transportation.org/Pages/default.aspx) receives project 
nominations in mid-September.  Problem statements can only be nominated by:
 - Federal Highway Administration
 - State DOTs
 - AASHTO Committee chairs
 
The SCOR votes on research statements and [they are announced](http://www.trb.org/NCHRP/UpcomingCRPProjects.aspx) 
in April.


### Research in Progress

TRB maintains a [database on research in progress](http://rip.trb.org/).

### Completed Research

Completed research through these programs can be found in the [TRID](http://trid.trb.org/) 
database.
