# Transportation Planning Applications Research Needs

This repository is a sandbox for research needs that will support better decision-making 
and design through transportation planning analysis.  These research needs are not 
necessarily fully thought-out yet and would benefit from collaborative refinement and 
widespread support.  It is sponsored by the [Transportation Research Board](http://www.trb.org) 
Committee on Planning Applications.

If you have a topic area that you think is a valid research need for our industry, you can 
add it to this list – even if you don't have a fully formed idea yet.  If you see a topic that 
is on this site, but you are interested in it or have a perspective to add, you can edit it.
Once an idea has a few interested parties and is sufficiently thought out, we can transfer 
it to the [Research Needs Database](http://rns.trb.org).  

We are testing the open, trackable, and user-friendly [ and free ] environment of GitHub to generate and edit research needs.  Please reach out to @e-lo if you have any problems using it.  There are plenty of helpful articles giving an overview of GitHub.  If you are new to it, then it might be helpful to read an [overview article](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1) that explains the gist.

## What will happen with them?

Nobody knows!  That said, there is a fairly defined process for progressing transportation 
research through the [National Academies of Sciences Transportation Research Board](http://www.trb.org). 
However, that is just one possibility for progressing research needs.  Another is contracting 
directly with a university either by yourself, using pooled funds, or via a research organization 
such as [researcHQ.org](http://ResearcHQ.org). The TRB research needs process is discussed below.
