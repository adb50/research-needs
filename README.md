# Transportation Planning Applications Research Needs

This repository is a sandbox for research needs that will support better decision-making 
and design through transportation planning analysis.  These research needs are not 
necessarily fully thought-out yet and would benefit from collaborative refinement and 
widespread support.  It is sponsored by the [Transportation Research Board](http://www.trb.org) 
Committee on Planning Applications.
